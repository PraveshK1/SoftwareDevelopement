It is testing at a system level to determine whether the system will withstand a very high volume of usage and to see what would happen outside its design expectations.</p><h3><strong>WHY DO SOAK TESTING?</strong></h3><p>A system may behave normally when used for 2 hours, but when the same system is used continuously for 10 hours or more, it may fail or behave abnormally/randomly, or it may crash. To predict such failures, Soak Testing is performed.</p><h3><strong>SETUP AND USAGE</strong></h3><p><ac:link><ri:page ri:content-title="Performance Testing JMeter" ri:version-at-save="3" /><ac:link-body>JMeter setup and usage.</ac:link-body></ac:link></p><p /><h2><strong>INTEGRATIONS STRESS TESTING V1.0</strong></h2><h3><strong>WHAT IS LOAD TESTING?</strong></h3><p>Load testing determines whether the web application under test can satisfy high load requirements or not.<br />It also helps to analyze overall server behavior under heavy load.</p><h3><strong>WHY DO LOAD TESTING?</strong></h3><p>Every web application has a maximum load capacity. If the load exceeds the web application&apos;s capacity, it may slow down, produce errors, or become unusable.<br />The primary purpose of load testing is to check how much load a system can handle, ensuring it meets user demands.</p><p>Load testing is also used to:</p><ul><li><p>Identify the maximum operating capacity of an application.</p></li><li><p>Determine if existing infrastructure is sufficient for expected load.</p></li><li><p>Define the number of users that can work on an application concurrently.</p></li></ul><p><strong>SETUP AND USAGE</strong></p><p>JMeter setup and usage.</p><h3><strong>HOW JMETER LOAD TESTING SIMULATES HEAVY LOAD?</strong></h3><ac:image ac:align="center" ac:layout="center" ac:original-height="411" ac:original-width="619" ac:custom-width="true" ac:alt="image-20250615-112251.png" ac:width="619"><ri:attachment ri:filename="image-20250615-112251.png" ri:version-at-save="1" /></ac:image><p /><p>JMeter simulates heavy load by:</p><ul><li><p>Making copies of samplers and running them in separate threads.</p></li><li><p>Simulating multiple users sending requests and receiving HTTP responses through samplers.</p></li><li><p>Evaluating application performance under increasing load conditions.</p></li></ul><p /><p /></body>
