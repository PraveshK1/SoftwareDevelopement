The free version of Confluence sucks, I cannot limit access, I only used it because I wanted to document things before I forgot and I am familiar with Confluence, if I gave you the shared account to log in please donâ€™t edit or delete,  thanks in advance

### ðŸ“š Software Development Reference Hub
Welcome to the  **Software Development Reference Hub**  â€” a curated, categorized gateway to essential development resources, process diagrams, best practices, and team accelerators. This space brings together structured guidance for consistent, scalable software delivery across projects and teams.

What you'll find here:


* [[ **UML Diagrams** |UML-Diagrams]] to visualize and standardize system behavior and structure and help development team work together with a common language for expressing their design concepts.


* [[ **Architecture Standards** |Standards-for-Software-Architecture]] covering clean code, solution structuring, and layered design


* [[ **Guidelines for General Operations** |Guide-Lines-for-General-Operations]]defines essential development standards, from focused Pull Request guidelines to sprint execution and estimation rules. It's designed to drive clarity, accountability, and consistent delivery within engineering teams.


* [[ **Visual Studio Project Naming Convention** |Visual-Studio-Webapi-Project-Naming-Convention]] This guide defines consistent class naming conventions and folder structures for Visual Studio Web API projects. It maps each class type to its role for streamlined development and onboarding,  **_there is a GitHub link at end to clone a scaffold solution_**  **.** 


* [[ **Developer Journey Guides** |Developer-Journey]] to help me guide other developers in their growth and also to help me cover my own areas to fill, i.e. Software Architecture Goals


* [[ **Testing Protocols** |Testing-Documents]] Test documents and guides used to evaluate product performance


* [[ **Integration Architecture** |Integration-Architecture]] An Integration Architecture I came up with and used previously 



Each guide is purpose-built to promote clarity, enforce consistency, and support just-in-time learning â€” from onboarding new developers to refining your architecture.
