# Code Review Guide

This guide contains advice and best practices for performing code reviews, and having your code reviewed.

## Everyone

* Accept that many programming decisions are opinions. Discuss tradeoffs, which you prefer, and reach a resolution quickly.
* Ask questions; don't make demands. ("What do you think about naming this `user_id`?")
* Ask for clarification. ("I didn't understand. Can you clarify?")
* Avoid selective ownership of code. ("mine," "not mine", "yours")
* Avoid using terms that could be seen as personal attacks. ("dumb", "stupid"). Assume everyone is attractive, intelligent, and well-meaning.
* Be explicit. Remember people don't always understand your intentions online.
* Be humble. ("I'm not sure - let's look it up.")
* Don't use hyperbole. ("always", "never", "endlessly", "nothing")
* Be careful about the use of sarcasm. Everything we do is public and what seems like good-natured ribbing to you and a long-time colleague might come off as mean and unwelcoming to a person new to the project.
* Consider one-on-one chats or video calls if there are too many "I didn't understand" or "Alternative solution:" comments. Post a follow-up comment summarizing one-on-one discussion.
* If you ask a question to a specific person, always start the comment by mentioning them; this will ensure they see it if their notification level is set to "mentioned" and other people will understand they don't have to respond.

## Reviewing Code

Understand why the change is necessary (fixes a bug, improves the user experience, refactors the existing code). Then:

* Try to be thorough in your reviews to reduce the number of iterations.
* Communicate which ideas you feel strongly about and those you don't.
* Identify ways to simplify the code while still solving the problem.
* Offer alternative implementations, but assume the author already considered them. ("What do you think about using a custom validator here?")
* Seek to understand the author's perspective.
* If you don't understand a piece of code, say so. There's a good chance someone else would be confused by it as well.
