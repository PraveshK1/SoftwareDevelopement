 **INTEGRATIONS TYPICAL LAYERS FOR MICROSERVICE ARCHITECTURE** 

 **PRESENTATION LAYER** 


* This layer handles the user interface and interaction with the microservices.  


* It can include components like web APIs, user interfaces, and mobile applications.



 **API GATEWAY LAYER** 


* The API gateway acts as a single entry point for clients to access the microservices.  


* It handles authentication, routing, load balancing, and other cross-cutting concerns.



 **SERVICE LAYER** 


* This layer contains the individual microservices that encapsulate specific business capabilities.  


* Each microservice is responsible for a specific task or functionality.  


* Microservices can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.



 **BUSINESS LOGIC LAYER** 


* This layer contains the core business logic of the microservices.  


* It processes requests, implements business rules, and orchestrates interactions between different microservices.



 **DATA ACCESS LAYER** 


* This layer is responsible for interacting with the underlying data storage systems, such as databases or external APIs.  


* It handles data retrieval, storage, and manipulation.



 **INFRASTRUCTURE LAYER** 


* This layer includes the infrastructure required to run microservices.  


* Examples include servers, containers, networking, and monitoring tools.
