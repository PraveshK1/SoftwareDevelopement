A use case diagram is a basic diagram of what a system does at a very high level and doesn't show a high level of detail.

The diagram should be restricted to just a simplistic visualization

It shows the following items:


* System or application (square box)


* People, organizations, or other systems that interact with it (stick man)


* What the system or application does (oval shape)


* Basic flows of what the system does (lines between objects)
