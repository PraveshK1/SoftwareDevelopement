 **BEST PRACTICES FOR PULL REQUESTS (PR)** 

 **WHAT SHOULD BE CONTAINED IN A PR** 


* PRs should be specific — aimed toward a single user story and not contain multiple unrelated changes.  


    * Exceptions would be when refactoring, but even refactors should have some order.



    
* PR should have an attached Work Item.




### HOW TO ENSURE WE HAVE REVIEWERS FOR PR

* As a minimum, two reviewers are required for a PR.  


* To ensure all PRs are addressed, we should implement a rotation system.



Got it, Pravesh. Here's the extracted text from your image:

 **INTEGRATIONS SPRINT RULES (WIP)** 


### ✅ TASK CREATION RULES

* All tasks added must have:  


    *  **Estimates** 


    *  **Time Spent** 


    *  **Time Remaining** 

    This helps ensure accurate burndown tracking.



    
* Once all user stories for the sprint are complete,  **additional tasks from user stories**  can be added.


* A  **training task**  will be added to every sprint to ensure consistent time allocation for learning.  


    * If user stories are complete,  **additional time can be used for training** .  


    * If training is needed for a specific story, the  **training task will be linked to that story** .



    
* When adding  **new high-priority (urgent) stories**  to the current sprint:  


    *  **Move lower priority stories**  to the next sprint.



    

 **ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA FOR INTEGRATIONS TEAM TO ESTIMATE WORK EFFORT** 


1.  **Requirements must be properly defined**  (this includes functional and non-functional requirements).  


1.  **Downstream dependencies**  must either:  


    * Have their functionality defined, or  


    * Have the complete system implemented and available.  



    
1.  **Proper documentation must exist for dependencies.** 


1.  **If decisions are still being made on dependencies** , this should be flagged as a  **risk**  (outside our control) when estimating work.
