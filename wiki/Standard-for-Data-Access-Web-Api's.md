 **INTEGRATIONS STANDARD FOR DATA ACCESS WEBAPI'S** 

 **INTRODUCTION** 

A data access web API is a construct that sits between an external system or entity and provides standard functions for creating, updating, reading, and deleting data.  

This is the ONLY functionality this layer performs.  

 **ARCHITECTURAL PATTERN** 

This is the Microservices architecture pattern.  

This means that the data access and business logic are separated into different services for scalability, maintainability, and flexibility.
